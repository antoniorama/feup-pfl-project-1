## Description of the Game

In this two-player board game, the objective is to accumulate points through strategic tile placement and removal during two main phases: the Placement Phase and the Scoring Phase.

Placement Phase:
The game begins with an empty board. Players take turns placing one of their tiles on unoccupied cells, starting with the player using dark tiles. If a player cannot place a tile, they pass, allowing the other player to continue. The phase concludes when the board cannot accommodate any more tiles, and any remaining tiles are kept aside for potential tie-breaking.

Scoring Phase:
Both players start with zero points. The first player to pass in the Placement Phase begins the Scoring Phase, removing one tile at a time from the board. Each removed tile must be equal to or longer than the last one removed by that player. Tiles under score counters cannot be removed. Points are scored by multiplying the number on the removed tile by the count of tiles along the removal line, with multipliers applied if score counters are on this line. The score counter is then moved along a path, aiming to reach a score of 100 points.
If any player cannot remove any of his tiles on his turn, he passes and is out of the game. The game ends when both players have passed.

## Game Logic

### Internal Game State Representation

[Describe how the game state is represented in Prolog, including examples of initial, intermediate, and final states.]


### Game State Visualization

[Describe how the game state display predicate `display_game/2` is implemented, including the user interface and input validation.]

### Move Validation and Execution

[Describe the predicate `move/3` for validating and executing a play.]

### List of Valid Moves

[Detail how the list of possible moves is generated with the predicate `valid_moves/3`.]

### End of Game

[Explain the predicate `game_over/2` for checking the end of the game and determining the winner.]

### Game State Evaluation

[Discuss how the game state is evaluated through the `value/3` predicate.]

### Computer Plays

[Describe how the computer selects a move using the `choose_move/4` predicate based on different levels of difficulty.]

## Conclusions

The development of this game was a multifaceted challenge that required the team to delve into complex logic structures and interactive design using Prolog, which is not commonly employed for game development. Successfully implementing the game's rules in a logical and user-friendly manner represents a significant accomplishment for our group.

Throughout the project, we encountered several constraints. Prolog's unique paradigm presented a steep learning curve, particularly in terms of state representation and visualization. Moreover, due to the language's limitations in graphical interfaces, the game lacks a modern, engaging UI which could potentially enhance user experience.

Implementing a more sophisticated AI by incorporating learning algorithms could provide a richer and more challenging gameplay experience.

In conclusion, this project not only provided a hands-on experience with Prolog but also contributed to the understanding of its capabilities and limitations within the scope of game development.
